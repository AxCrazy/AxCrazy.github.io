<center><p class="one"><font-family: 'Trocchi', serif;>Featured in the legendary car chase scene in Bullitt, the Mustang first generation, aka the Mach One was built by Ford in 1964 until 1973. Known as the pony car, the Mach One's styling; its long bonnet and short rear, proved widly popular and has inspired all kinds of imitations and influences car design to this day. Indeed, the Mustang persists to this day and 2016 version can be purchased even in Ireland!</font-family>

<center><p class="one">In 1962, the head engineers of the Mustang project had five simple aims. Seat four, have bucket seats and a floor mounter gearstick, weight less then 1100kg, sell for less then $2500 and have multiple power, comfort and luxury options. Lincoln-Mercury design studio produced the design and the Mach One came in either soft or hardtop, with a choice of engines ranging from a 2.8L six cylinder, to a 4.7L Windsor V8 block. 3 and 4 speed gearboxes were available and the car weighed in at 1109kg. The Mach One's popularity was undeniable. Never before could such power and looks come at such a low price tag. Even today, the Mustang costs barely $40000 brand new. Depending on condition, today a Mach One can fetch over $200,000 at auction.
