Another blue collar car from Ford, the Capri was introduced in Brussels in 1969. The intention was to reproduce the success of the Mustang to a European market. It was based on the Cortina and built in the UK, Belgium and Germany. Although it was a fastback coupe, Ford wanted the Capri to be affordable and as such it was made with a variety of engines ranging from a 1.3L 4 cylinder, to a 5.0L Windsor V8.

The Capri was a big hit, selling 400,000 cars until 1970. In 1972, Ford revised the car with better suspension, tail lights and new seats. Newer engines were introduced and in 1973 alone, the Capri sold 253,000 vehicles and the 1,000,000th Capri was built in August. Following the success, the MkII was launched in 1974 and the MkIII in 1978 and production continued until 1986.

This is a car quite close to home with me. My recently passed away father owned one in the early 1980s and many times he would speak of how much he loved it, all the fun he had with it and many times down the years at Vintage shows we would seek out all manner of different Capri's and experience first hand the beautiful styling, drifting all day long and the speed and driving experience. The Capri followed a long line of Ford rally cars beginning with the Escort and to this very day, the Focus performs well at rallys all over the world.
