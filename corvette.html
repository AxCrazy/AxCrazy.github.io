<center><p class="one">Along with the Mach One and the Dodge Charger, the C2 Stingray is another 1960s American classic that really stands out for me. Chevrolet began production in 1963 until 1967. One of the first cars tested using wind tunnels, this really refined the final, beautiful shape. The famous divided rear window was futuristic, unusual and ahead of its time. Quad headlamps, coupe doors cut into the roof, faux vents and a revamped interior and the use of stronger, yet lighter materials made for a safer, more modern car.

<center><p class="one">The Stingray also came with independent rear suspension, shock absorbers, revamped tranmission and a range of engines from the standard 4.7L V8, to the monstrous 7.0L V8 engine. Power output ranged from 250bhp, to 372bhp. Over time the Stingray was tweaked and changed from year to year until 1967. Average price at auction is around $120,000 but certain models can fetch as much as $3,000,000.
