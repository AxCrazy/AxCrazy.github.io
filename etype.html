<center><p class="one">The iconic 60s sports car, even today the E Type dazzles people with its beauty. Truly a car ahead of its time, the E Type boasted monocoque construction, disc brakes, rack and pinion steering and independent suspension. It was the first production vehicle to not use a seperate body bolted onto a chassis. In March 2008, the Jaguar E-Type ranked first in The Daily Telegraph online list of the world's "100 most beautiful cars" of all time.

In March 1961, the Series 1 was introduced, boasting a 3.8L six cylinder Jaguar XK6 engine. This was increased to 4.2L in October 1964. Producing 265bhp and a top speed of 150mph and an independent rear suspension, the E Type performed like no other car of its time. And just look at it. I was fortunate enough many years ago to see and be driven in an E Type and the sense of speed and the sheer beauty of the car is something I won't easily forget.

In its entire lifecycle, around 75000 E Type Jaguars were built. In it's 14 year life, 3 variations of the E Type were produced but it's iconic looks remain legendary to this day. Depending on the model and condition, an E Type Jaguar can fetch over $1,000,000 at a Vintage Car Auction. Series 1 cars in particular are highly sought after.
