<center><p class="one">While the Ventora wasn't a commercial success for Vauxhall(issues with the gearbox being the main problem for buyers), it did innovate the large engined saloon cars the Germans do so well in modern times. Would the M3, the RS4 and the likes even exist if not for the Ventora? Perhaps not. Legendary motorsports commentator Murray Walker owned one. Launched in the spring of 1968, the Ventora was intended to give Vauxhall a brigther image to the public, seen as bland and dull. General Motors owned Vauxhall and you can see the American muscle car styling it clearly drew influence from. A staggering price tag of only a thousand pounds made it even more attractive.

While cheap, unfortunately the Ventora had to make some sacrifices for this low cost. Low gearing and fixed front seats and the engine was actually and old Chevrolet lump used in Bedford trucks and poor insulatation lead to an awful lot of wind noise for what was at the time very highly praised in test reports, a rarity for Vauxhall at the time. Unfortunately the issues with the transmission and rapidly wearing clutches tarnished the car and despite improvements sales were never great. However, it did show that with refinements and tweaks, large engined saloon cars that you can safely take the kids to school in, and then rally all the way home were possible. Remember the Ventora the next time a BMW 330 or Audi RS4 goes flying past you!

Another car close to home, my father owned a Ventora during the 1980s, he covered every inch of Ireland in it, yet somehow never got caught for speeding and never wrote it off :) While he loved the speed, he didn't care so much for worn clutch cables and rusting front wings. Vauxhall build quality was never the best! Ventora's are still ran by enthusiasts and can be restored or purchased at Auction for about 5000-10000 euros depending on condition.
